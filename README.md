# niri-switch - A niri task switcher

niri-switch implements fast task switching for the [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) compositor. It aims to provide functionality similar to the Alt-Tab known from Windows, Gnome, KDE Plasma and many other desktop environments.

The main use case is quickly switching between windows located on different displays and/or workspaces.

The program is currently **usable** and quite stable. It still requires a few features to be completed to actually deliver a good user experience. But anyone is welcome to play around with it and provide much appreciated feedback.

## Dependencies

* `niri` - niri-switch needs a running niri session to connect to it via IPC socket.
* `gtk4`, `gtk4-layer-shell` - needed to display the graphical interface. The minimal required version of GTK4 is `4.12`.

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

The [niri-switch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/niri-switch) package is available on AUR for Arch-based distributions. You can install it via any AUR wrapper you like (yay, paru etc.). For example:

```sh
paru -S niri-switch
```

### NixOS (Flake)

This repository provides a flake you can use to install the package.

<details>
<summary>Show detailed instructions</summary>

To install it you **must have flake enabled** and your NixOS configuration
**must be managed with flakes.** See [https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) for
instructions on how to install and enable them on NixOS.

Next, you can add this flake as inputs in `flake.nix` in the repository
containing your NixOS configuration:

```nix
inputs = {
  # ---Snip---
  niri-switch= {
    url = "github:Kiki-Bouba-Team/niri-switch";
    # Optional, by default this flake follows the latest nixpkgs-unstable.
    # ---
    # Note that setting this will make it follow your version of nixpkgs, which
    # can lead to issue if you lock it to nixpkgs stable. If you don't add this
    # line, the derivation will be bigger, but will work Out Of the Box.
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
  # ---Snip---
}
```

Then you can install niri-switch by adding the package provided by this flake in your configuration, for example:

```nix
{inputs, pkgs, ...}:
let
  inherit (pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform) system;
in
{
    environment.systemPackages = [
        inputs.niri-switch.packages.${system}.default
    ];
}
```
This example only works if you can access `inputs` as an extra argument in your configuration.

### Other distributions

On other distributions you will need `cargo` - the Rust build system. It's usually installed via [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Clone the repository and run `cargo install --path ./niri-switch`.

Make sure that `~/.cargo/bin` is in your `$PATH`. You can verify the installation by running `niri-switch --version`.

## Getting started


After installation you need to add the following configuration to your niri config at `~/.config/niri/config.kdl`:
```kdl
spawn-at-startup "niri-switch-daemon"

binds {
    // Append to existing binds section
    Alt+Tab { spawn "niri-switch"; }
}
```

**After restarting the niri session, niri-switch will be ready to use.**
> [!NOTE]
> You can bind the command to any key combination, `Alt+Tab` is just an example.

> [!TIP]
> Instead of `spawn-at-startup`, you can write a custom systemd service for `graphical-session.target` if you want more control over the daemon.

## Navigation

After opening the overlay (e.g. via Alt + Tab), you can move around with arrow keys and select a window with Enter. To exit without focusing on any window, press Escape.

Repeated calls to `niri-switch` will also advance the selection.

To enable switching to the previous window (similar to `Alt+Shift+Tab` in other environments), add another keybinding to your `niri` config using the `--previous` option.

```kdl
binds {
    // Append this line to the existing binds section
    Alt+Shift+Tab { spawn "niri-switch" "--previous"; }
}
```

## Default themes

niri-switch is based on GTK4 and will use your system's default GTK settings. The config is usually located at `~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini` and can be modified. For example, if you want to use a dark theme in niri-switch without any CSS modification, you can add 
```
[Settings]
gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme = true
```
to the `settings.ini` file (this will have a global effect). Or run the `niri-switch-daemon` with `GTK_THEME` environment variable.

## Customization

You can customize the look by providing custom `~/.config/niri-switch/style.css` file. The default configuration is located in `src/daemon/gui/style.css`. You can copy and modify it.

To examine the CSS classes and the widget hierarchy, you can run the daemon with debug flag: `GTK_DEBUG=interactive niri-switch-daemon` and play around in the inspector.

GTK supports only a specific subset of CSS properties. You can learn more about it in GTK [documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html).

The configuration is loaded at the daemon startup in this order:

* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/niri-switch/style.css` - if the environment variable is set and file exists.
* `$HOME/.config/niri-switch/style.css` - if the above does not exist or environment variable is not set.
* Embedded `src/daemon/gui/style.css` - if none of the above exist or required variables are not set.
